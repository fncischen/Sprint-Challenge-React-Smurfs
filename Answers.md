1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Routing is a means to help make website navigation seamless - each time data that is rendered on the browser changes (due to changes in URL)-  while still maintaining a consistent web design throughout the user's journey on the browser.   

* Server side routing means conditional rendering is dependent upon data that is routed, or directed, to & from a separate server file(s). Each time data is changed, the browser has to reload since you have to make put, push, request reuqest to a separate server file.
* Client side routing means conditional rendering is dependent upon data that is routed, or directed, to and from the browser based on internal Javascript programs or libraries that are on the browser. Client side routing does not require the browser to be reloaded or refreshed, each time there's new data, since we are merely
changing the state of components on the browser.
